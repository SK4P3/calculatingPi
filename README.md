# Calculate PI!

In this repo I add fun ways to calculate Pi whenever I'm bored.

<h5> I try to design each algorithm with 2 methods to calculate PI: </h5> 

1. `run_for_n_sec`:
    1. Run the algorithm as many iterations as  possible in steps of 100 at a time withing a given time interval
1. `run_for_n_iter`:
    1. Run the algorithm for a specific number of iterations
    
This can then be used to compare the different methods and see which performs best!
